You are generating a weekly learning reflection based on the following work notes.

These are the notes recorded by the user:

{entries}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Write the reflection in the SAME LANGUAGE as the notes.
- Do not translate unless the notes themselves mix languages.
- Do not introduce new information or concepts.
- Do not speculate beyond what is recorded.
- Do not correct the user’s understanding.
- Do not add best practices, advice, or recommendations.
- Stay grounded strictly in what the user wrote.

The purpose of this reflection is to help the user
summarize, organize, and categorize what they learned,
so it can be reviewed and learned from later.


OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep the reflection concise and structured.
- Total length should be approximately 120–200 words.
- Use bullet points where requested.
- Use clear, neutral, professional language.

You MUST include all sections below.

## Summary
In 2–3 sentences, summarize the overall focus of the user’s learning this week.
Describe the types of work or topics involved, not just activities.

## Key Learnings
List 3–5 bullet points.
Each bullet should capture one concrete learning, realization, or takeaway,
paraphrased from the notes using the user’s own framing.

## Categories
Group the learnings into 2–3 categories.
For each category:
- Give a short category label
- Add 1 sentence describing what kinds of learnings fall into it

Categories should reflect how the user’s notes naturally cluster,
not external taxonomies.

## Notable Moment
Briefly describe one specific moment, issue, or realization from the notes
that stands out as particularly meaningful or illustrative.
Paraphrase concrete details from the entry.

Do not add any extra sections.
Do not stop mid-sentence.
